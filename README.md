# Machine Learning Assignment – Week 2

This repository contains my Week 2 Machine Learning tasks.  
The main focus of this week was on **Decision Tree classification** and **model evaluation using performance metrics**.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Task 1: Decision Tree Classification
In this task, Decision Tree models were implemented using multiple real-world datasets to understand how decision-based splitting works for classification problems.

Datasets used:
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
- Titanic Survival Dataset
- PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset
- Credit Card Fraud Dataset
- Student Performance Dataset

The Decision Tree algorithm was used to:
- Split data based on important features
- Understand interpretability of models
- Observe how tree depth affects performance

### 🔹 Task 2: Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics
In this task, different evaluation techniques were applied to analyze model performance beyond accuracy.

Metrics and techniques used:
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC Curve & AUC
- Cross-Validation
- Bias–Variance Trade-off

Special focus was given to:
- Recall in medical datasets
- Precision vs Recall trade-off in fraud detection
- Why accuracy alone is misleading in imbalanced datasets
